*** Documentation!!!

Priority changes for 0.9 (Cygwin 1.7):

* Fix rcs tarball names to allow more than one at a time
* cross: overhaul, support mingw (perhaps separate mingw.cygclass)
* Debug and/or Verbose mode
* Fix all FIXMEs


The rest is a wishlist of features to add in future releases, in no
particular order:

* Documentation (man/info/HTML ??)
* Complete test suite
* NLS
* dolocale
* dosed
* Additional cygclasses:
	- alternatives
	- relocate: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2006-10/msg00743.html
* Windows shortcuts for X11 programs
	doico /path/to/pixmap.png [calls png(to|2)ico and doins]
	make_win_shortcut Foo [run.exe foo.exe -wait --display=...]
* error(): use 'caller' builtin?
* Split debug
* If a dependency DLL's package was not found with "cygcheck -f"
  (e.g. it was installed manually), show the DLL path instead.
