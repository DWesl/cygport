#****v* Uploading/SSH_KEY
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Path to the SSH private key corresponding to the public key registered
#  for uploading on sourceware. If you already have your private key loaded
#  into a running ssh-agent(1), or if the key file has one of the expected
#  file names such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa, then you probably don't need to set this.
#  Note that for now it doesn't work to supply an encrypted SSH key with SFTP.
#  You'll have to provide either an ssh-agent with your key already loaded, or
#  a path to an unencrypted key in SSH_KEY.
#****
