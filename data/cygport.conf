#****** Configuration/cygport.conf
#  DESCRIPTION
#  The cygport.conf file can be used by users to customize certain aspects
#  of cygport's behaviour.  Users who wish to customize their settings should
#  copy the default /etc/cygport.conf file to $HOME/.cygport.conf and edit the
#  latter.

#****v* Configuration/CFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to CC when compiling C code.  Individual packages may append
#  or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  CFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -O2 -pipe
#****
#CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe "

#****v* Configuration/CPPFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to the preprocessor.  Individual packages may append
#  or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  CPPFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.

#****v* Configuration/CXXFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to CXX when compiling C++ code.  Individual packages may append
#  or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  CXXFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -O2 -pipe
#****
#CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

#****v* Configuration/FFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to F77 when compiling Fortran 77 code.  Individual packages may
#  append or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  FFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -O2 -pipe

#FFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

#****v* Configuration/FCFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to FC when compiling Fortran 95 code.  Individual packages may
#  append or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  FCFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -O2 -pipe

#****v* Configuration/GCJFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to GCJ when native-compiling Java code.  Individual packages may
#  append or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  GCJFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly

#****v* Configuration/LDFLAGS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to the linker.  Individual packages may append
#  or override this value if they will not build correctly without it.
#  WARNING
#  LDFLAGS should only be set in cygport.conf by users who wish to rebuild
#  their packages with a particular optimization.  Package maintainers should
#  NOT change this value, as doing so may cause packages not to work correctly
#  on other systems.

#LDFLAGS=""

#****v* Configuration/MAKEOPTS
#  DESCRIPTION
#  Flags passed to cygmake.  The primary purpose of MAKEOPTS is to control
#  parallel make.  Some packages may not build correctly with parallel make
#  due to broken Makefile rules; such packages, if not easily patched, can
#  append "-j1" to MAKEOPTS or cygmake to force serial make for that package.
#  DEFAULT VALUE
#  -j [nprocs + 1]
#****
#MAKEOPTS=-j3


# If defined to a non-zero value, activates GPG signing of .cygport
# files and patches If undefined, signing is deactivated by default.
#

#****v* Configuration/SIG
#  DESCRIPTION
#  If defined to a non-zero value, activates GPG signing of .cygport files
#  and patches, providing that the gnupg package is installed.
#  NOTE
#  This is a user-specific setting and must NOT be set or used in .cygport files.
